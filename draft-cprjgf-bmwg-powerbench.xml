    <abstract>

   <t>This document defines a standard mechanism to measure, report, and
   compare power usage of different networking devices and under different
   network configurations and conditions.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
	
   <t>Energy efficiency is becoming increasingly important in the operation
   of network infrastructure. Network devices are typically always on, but
   in some cases, they run at very low average utilization rates. Both network
   utilization and power consumption of these devices can be improved, and that starts with a normalized characterization.
   The metrics defined here will help operators to get a more accurate idea
   of the power consumed by their network and will also help vendors to 
   test the energy efficiency of their devices.</t>

   <t>There is no standard mechanism to benchmark the power utilization 
   of networking devices like routers or switches. 
   <xref target="I-D.manral-bmwg-power-usage" /> started to analyze the issue.
   This document defines the mechanism to correctly characterize and benchmark 
   the power consumption of networking devices to better 
   estimate and compare their power usage.</t>
   
   <t>The benchmarking methodology of energy efficiency may enable intelligent
   decisions to optimize the power consumption for individual devices
   and the network as a whole. Benchmarks are also required to compare
   the effectiveness of various energy optimization techniques.</t>

     <section title="Requirements Language">   
    <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
    "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
	<xref target="RFC2119" /> <xref target="RFC8174" /> when, and only when,
    they appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>
     </section>
	 
    </section>

    <section title="Power Consumption Benchmarking">
	
   <t>The maximum power a device can consume does not accurately 
   reflect the power consumed under a normal workload.
   Indeed, the power consumption of a networking device depends on its 
   configuration, connected transceivers, and traffic load. 
   Relying merely on the maximum rated power can overestimate the total
   energy networking devices consume.</t>

   <t>A network device consists of many components, each of which
   consumes power (for example, it is possible to mention the power
   consumption of the CPU, data forwarding ASIC, memory, fan, etc.).
   Therefore, it is important to formulate a consistent benchmarking
   method for network devices and consider the workload variation 
   and test conditions.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Test Methodology">	  
	
     <section title="Test Setup">	 	
   <t>The test setup in general is compliant with <xref target="RFC2544" />.
   The Device Under Test (DUT) is connected to a Tester and a Power Meter.
   The Power Meter allows to measure the power consumption of the device and
   can be used to measure power under various configurations and conditions.
   Tests SHOULD be done with bidirectional traffic that better reflects the real environment.
   The Tester is also a traffic generator that enables changing traffic conditions.    
   It is OPTIONAL to choose a non-equal proportion for upstream and downstream traffic.</t>

   <t>It is worth mentioning that the DUT also dissipates significant heat.
   That means that part of the power is used for actual work while the rest
   is dissipated as heat. This heating can lead to more power consumed
   by fans/ compressor for cooling the devices. The benchmarking methodology
   does not measure the power consumed by external cooling infrastructure.
   The Power Meter only measures the internal power consumption of the device.
   It is OPTIONAL to measure the device's temperature change, which
   can be correlated to the amount of external power consumed to cool the device.</t>
     </section>  
	 
     <section title="Traffic and Device Characterization">

   <t>An important factor that impacts power consumption is the 
   offered traffic load. Therefore, power measurements must be performed
   with different traffic loads to the network device.</t>

   <t>There are different interface types on a network device and the power usage 
   also depends on the kind of connector/transceiver used. 
   The interface type used needs to be specified as well.</t>
   
   <t>In addition, it is necessary to indicate the number of ports used per linecard 
   as well as the aggregate bandwidth that each linecard can accommodate.</t>
   
   <t>The traffic load also needs to be specified because different packet sizes 
   may not affect power consumption, but the inter-packet delay may affect it.</t>

	<section title="Benchmarking Tests">
	
	 <section title="Base Power">
	 
	 <t>Objective: To determine the  base power consumed by the network device,
	 which typically consists of processors, fans, memory, etc.</t>
	 
	 <t>Procedure: the measurement is done without activating the traffic generator.</t>

     <t>Reporting format: the results of the power measurement SHOULD be
     reported according to <xref target="report" />.</t>
	 
	 <t>This measurement is useful since it permits to calculate the 
	 additional energy consumption that will result when the 
	 traffic load changes.</t>

	 <section title="Power Consumption with Traffic Load">
	 
	 <t>Objective: To determine the power consumed by a device which should be proportional 
	 to its traffic load.</t>

	 <t>Procedure: a specific number of packets at a specific rate is sent to specific ports/linecards
	 of the DUT.</t>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>
	The benchmarking characterization described in this document is constrained 
	to a controlled environment (as a laboratory) and includes controlled stimuli. 
      	The  network under benchmarking MUST NOT be connected to production networks.
         </t>
         <t>
          Beyond these, there are no specific security considerations within the scope of this document.
