1.  Introduction

   Energy Efficiency is becoming increasingly important in the operation
   of network infrastructure.  Network devices are typically always on,
   but in some cases they run at very low average utilization rates.
   Network utilization of these devices can be improved and their power
   consumption as well.  The metrics defined here will help operators to
   get a more accurate idea of the power consumed by their network and
   will also help vendors to test the energy efficiency on their
   devices.

   There is no standard mechanism to benchmark power utilization of
   networking devices like routers or switches.
   [I-D.manral-bmwg-power-usage] started to analyze the issue.  This
   document defines the mechanism to correctly characterize and
   benchmark the power consumption of networking devices in order to be
   able to correctly estimate and compare their power usage.

   The benchmarking methodology of the energy efficiency may enable
   intelligent decisions to optimize the power consumption for
   individual devices and the network as a whole.  Benchmarks are also
   required to compare effectiveness of various energy optimization
   techniques.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Power consumption benchmarks

   The maximum power that be can consumed by the device does not
   accurately reflect the actual power consumed under a normal work
   load.  Indeed, power consumption of a networking device is dependent
   on the device configuration and traffic load.  Relying merely on the
   maximum rated power can overestimate the total energy consumed by
   networking devices.

   A network device consists of a lot of components, each of which
   consumes power (for example, it is possible to mention the power
   consumption of the CPU, data forwarding ASIC, memory, fan etc.).
   Therefore, it is important to formulate a consistent benchmarking
   method for network devices and consider the variation of the workload
   and test conditions.

3.  Test Methodology

3.1.  Test Setup

   The test setup in general is compliant with [RFC2544].  The Device
   Under Test (DUT) is connected to a Tester and to a Power Meter.  The
   Power Meter allows to measure the power consumption of the device and
   can be used to measure power under a variety of configurations and
   conditions.  Tests SHOULD be done with bidirectional traffic that
   better reflects the real environment.  The Tester is also a traffic
   generator which enables to change the traffic conditions.  It is
   OPTIONAL to choose a non-equal proportion for upstream and downstream
   traffic.

                                   |

                              |  Meter   |
                              +----------+

                            Figure 1: Test setup

   It is worth mentioning that the DUT also dissipates significant heat.
   That means that part of the power is used for actual work while the
   rest is dissipated as heat.  This heating can lead to more power
   consumed by fan/ compressor for cooling the devices.  The
   benchmarking methodology does not measure the power consumed by
   external cooling infrastructure.  The Power Meter only measures the
   internal power consumption of the device.  It is OPTIONAL to measure
   also the temperature change of the device which can be correlated to
   the amount of external power consumed to cool the device.

3.2.  Traffic and Device characteristics

   An important factor that impacts the power consumption is the offered
   traffic load.  Therefore, power measurements must be performed with
   different traffic loads to the network device.

   There are different interface type on a network device and the power
   usage can also depends on the kind of connector/transceiver used.
   The interface type used needs to be specified as well.

   In addition, it is necessary to indicate the number of ports used per
   linecard as well as the aggregate bandwidth that each linecard can
   accommodate.

   The traffic load also needs to be specified because different packet
   sizes may not effect power consumption but the inter-packet delay may
   affect it.

4.  Reporting Format

 
      Network Device Hardware and Software versions: for the
      benchmarking tests, it must be specified.

 
      Number and type of line cards: for each test the total number of
      line cards and their types can be varied and must be specified.

 
      Number of enabled ports: for each test the number of enabled and
      disabled ports must be specified.

 
      Number of active ports: for each test the number of active and
      inactive ports must be specified.

 
      Port settings and interface types: for each test the port
      configuration and settings need to be specified.

 
      Port Utilization: for each test the port utilization of each port
      must be specified.  The actual traffic load can use the
      information defined in [RFC2544].

 
      Traffic attributes (packet size, packet rate, etc.): for each test
      it must be specified.

 
      CPU load: for each test it must be specified.

 
      Power measurement: for each test it must be specified.  All power
      measurements are done in Watts.

5.  Benchmarking Tests

5.1.  Base Power

   Objective: To determine the base power consumed by the network
   device, which tipically consists of processors, fans, memory, etc.

   Procedure: the measurement is done without activating the traffic
   generator.

   Reporting format: the results of the power measurement SHOULD be
   reported according to Section 4.

   This measurement is useful since it permits to calculate the
   additional energy consumption that will result when the traffic load
   changes.

5.2.  Power Consumption with traffic load

   Objective: To determine the power consumed by a device which should
   be proportional to its traffic load.

   Procedure: a specific number of packets at a specific rate is sent to
   specific ports/linecards of the DUT.

   Reporting format: the results of the power measurement SHOULD be
   reported according to Section 4.
